The University Visualization System focuses on analyzing university/school data, its trend over the years, and its course structure. Visual representation about the number of registered students each year, their grades, the distribution of different faculties and professors, their genders, the courses and their prerequisites can be obtained with just a couple of clicks. The statistical data can be visualized in the form of bar charts and donut charts so that they are easy to understand and interpret.
