Steps to run the code:
- Extract the project ZIP folder and place the folder in the localhost location.
  I have been using WAMP to create localhost. So, I place it in the "www" folder.
- In the browser, type the URL: "localhost/visualization-project-B00840003/index.html".
- This is the index page of the system which displayes gender distribution and the faculty distribution.
- You can navigate to the "Registered Students" page and "Courses" page from the buttons on the screen.
- To go to "Registered Students" page, type the URL: "localhost/visualization-project-B00840003/registered_students.html".
- In this module, you can change the year by changing the slider position on the top of the screen.
  If you click on any bar, you can see the grades distribution of the students for that program in the selected year.
  Hovering over the bars or the donut segments show you the details.
- To go to the "Courses" page, type the URL: "localhost/visualization-project-B00840003/courses.html".
